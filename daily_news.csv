0,Opposition candidate Muizzu beats India-friendly Solih in Maldives presidential run-off,"September 30, 2023 09:38 pm | Updated October 01, 2023 01:47 am IST - COLOMBO  Front runner and Opposition candidate Mohamed Muizzu was elected President of the Maldives on Saturday, as he beat the India-friendly incumbent, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, in a closely fought contest. The outcome signals a likely shift in both domestic governance and foreign policy of the island nation.  Mr. Muizzu garnered about 54% of the vote, while Mr. Solih secured nearly 46%, according to the provisional results published by Male-based media. Saturday’s presidential election run-off saw a higher voter turnout of 86%, compared to the 79.85% recorded in the first —the lowest seen in a Maldivian presidential election — that proved inconclusive.  Also read: The Hindu Profiles: Who is Mohamed Muizzu?  The vote for change in the Maldives comes after a strong anti-incumbency sentiment against the Solih administration, and a concerted Opposition campaign led by his rival, former President and jailed leader Abdulla Yameen, demanding ‘India out’ of the country.  President Solih came under sharp attack from the Opposition for his stated ‘India first’ policy.  Mr. Muizzu, in his campaign ahead of the second round of the presidential polls, yet again promised to “safeguard the country’s independence and sovereignty”. While the Opposition coalition’s (People’s National Congress-Progressive Party of Maldives) pro-China stance in the past is no secret, observers within the Maldives have said Mr. Muizzu is unlikely to abruptly sever ties with India. The newly elected leader would seek to balance India-China ties, they note, even as New Delhi hopes for continuity in India’s many infrastructure projects across the island nation.  A civil engineer by training, Mr. Muizzu will have his task cut out, as the country faces multiple challenges of mounting debt, dwindling foreign reserves, and heightening climate risks. The top two candidates had made big promises on housing, a preoccupation for the Maldivian voter, as the island nation battles congestion and development skewed towards capital Male, while several other atolls await basic amenities.  The Maldives is also preparing for a referendum next month, for citizens to decide if the country must switch to a parliamentary system of governance, a long-time demand of former President and parliamentary Speaker Mohamed Nasheed. After his fallout with his party colleague and friend Mr. Solih —it is seen as a major reason for Mr. Solih’s electoral defeat —Mr. Nasheed backed a young aspirant who came third in the first round on September 9, and subsequently exited the race.","September 30, 2023 09:38 pm | Updated October 01, 2023 01:47 am IST - COLOMBO  Front runner and Opposition candidate Mohamed Muizzu was elected President of the Maldives on Saturday, as he beat the India-friendly incumbent, Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, in a closely fought contest.

2,Canada must not become a 'hub of all murderers': Bangladesh Foreign Minister,"""Murderers can go to Canada and take shelter, and they can have a wonderful life while those he killed, their relatives are suffering (sic),"" Momen was quoted as saying in the interview by the Times of India.  Speaking about one of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's killers, the minister said, ""He’s having a good life in Canada. He has been there. We have been requesting the Canadian government to send back self-confessed killer of Bangabandhu, the father of our nation. Unfortunately, Canada is not listening to us and they have come up with a variety of excuses. So, we also went to the Canadian court to understand what is the status since he is staying in Canada for a long time (sic)"".  ""So we are saying that Canada’s government is a government of the rule of law, they believe in the legal system. Canada must not be a hub of all murderers.

3,"US House Passes Bipartisan Bill To Avoid Government Shutdown, Senate Vote Next","The bill has been sent to the Senate to avoid a government freeze (Representational)  Last-gasp moves to prevent a US government shutdown took a dramatic step forward Saturday, as Democrats overwhelmingly backed an eleventh-hour Republican measure to keep federal funding going for 45 days, albeit with a freeze on aid to Ukraine.  The stopgap proposal adopted by the House of Representatives with a vote of 335-91 was pitched by Speaker Kevin McCarthy just hours before a midnight shutdown deadline that would have seen millions of federal employees and military personnel sent home or required to work without pay.  The deal still has to be approved by the Democrat-controlled Senate.  CNN quoted an administration official as saying the White House would likely support the bill in order to keep the government open with the expectation of being able to restore Ukraine aid later.  The shutdown crisis was largely triggered by a small group of hardline Republicans who had defied their own party leadership to scupper various temporary funding proposals as they pressed for deep spending cuts.  Saturday's agreement could end up costing McCarthy his job, as the hardliners had threatened to remove him as speaker if a stopgap measure they opposed was passed with Democrat support.  Pitching his last-gasp proposal, McCarthy had appealed to both Republicans and Democrats to ""put your partisanship away"" and dismissed the threat to his job.  ""If somebody wants to remove (me) because I want to be the adult in the room, go ahead and try,"" he said.  The proposed plan would keep the government funded at current levels without the hardline-backed spending cuts that Democrats had viewed as a non-starter. But the lack of assistance for Ukraine was problematic.  Arming and funding Ukraine in its desperate war against the Russian invasion has been a key policy plank for President Joe Biden's administration and, while the stopgap is only temporary, it does raise questions over the political viability of renewing the multibillion-dollar flow of assistance.  The Democrat-controlled Senate had been prepared to vote on its own stopgap bill later Saturday -- one that did include funding for Ukraine.  ""This is enough to keep the government open, and I'm not going to shut the government down over foreign aid,"" one House Democrat, Jared Moskowitz, told CNN, while making clear he was a strong supporter of Ukraine aid.  The freeze of all but critical government services had been set to start after midnight (0400 GMT Sunday), immediately delaying salaries for millions of federal employees and military personnel.  A shutdown would have meant the majority of national parks, for example -- from the iconic Yosemite and Yellowstone in the west to Florida's Everglades swamp -- would be closed to public access beginning Sunday.  With student loan payments resuming in October, officials also said Friday that key activities at the Federal Student Aid office would continue for a couple of weeks.  But a prolonged shutdown could cause bigger disruptions, percolating through the wider economy.

4,‘Didn’t even spare cow dung': PM Modi's corruption charge at ruling Congress in Chhattisgarh,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday hit out at the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in poll-bound Chhattisgarh, accusing it of blocking Centre's development projects meant for the state.    “It is my guarantee that your dreams are my resolution... Your dreams will be fulfilled only when there is a BJP government here. No matter how many efforts we make from Delhi, the Congress here fails those efforts. In the last five years, Chhattisgarh got thousands of crores of rupees here. Roads, rail, electricity, and various other development projects, we did not keep any scarcity of money for the state”, Modi told party workers at the ‘Parivartan Maha Sankalp’ rally in the poll-bound state's Bilaspur.    Chhattisgarh assembly election 2023: Full coverage Prime Minister Narendra Modi addresses a rally in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur. (X/PTI)  The prime minister accused the Congress government of corruption. “Congress committed corruption in liquor; didn't even spare cow dung. Congress government in Chhattisgarh also committed corruption in ration given under PM Garib Kalyan Yojana”, he said.    During the rally, the prime minister invoked Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister TS Singh Deo's remark in which the latter claimed the Centre showed no bias to the Congress-ruled state when it came to development works.    “Deputy CM said this is a public gathering... In public life, realities cannot be hidden. If the Deputy CM says that Delhi does no injustice, this should have been a matter of happiness for all, but Congress had a hurricane. The Indian government approved infrastructure in Chhattisgarh projects worth thousands of crores. They are either halted or delayed”, Modi added.    “No matter how much I try to deliver (development) from Delhi, the Congress government here (in Chhattisgarh) always make sure that it doesn't reach to you”, he said.    “Change is finalised in Chhattisgarh. The excitement seen here is the declaration of change. People of Chhattisgarh have decided to not tolerate Congress' atrocities anymore”, PM Modi said, sharpening his attack on the Congress government in the state.

5,Afghan Embassy Announces Decision To Cease India Operations From Today,"Afghan Embassy Shutdown: The embassy said that this decision is made after careful consideration  The Afghanistan Embassy in India announced Saturday night that it is ceasing its operations from October 1, citing a lack of support from the host government, failure to meet expectations in serving Afghanistan's interests, and a reduction in personnel and resources.  In a statement, the Afghanistan Embassy in New Delhi said it regrets to announce the decision to cease its operations, effective October 1, 2023.  ""It is with profound sadness, regret, and disappointment that the Embassy of Afghanistan in New Delhi announces this decision to cease its operations,"" the statement said.  The embassy said that this decision, while deeply regrettable, is made after careful consideration, taking into account the historic ties and long-standing partnership between Afghanistan and India.  The Embassy statement also listed key factors affecting its ability to continue the mission effectively and said that they were the primary reasons for the ""unfortunate closure"".  The Embassy cited a ""lack of support from the host government"", alleging that it has experienced a notable absence of crucial support from the host government, which it said hindered its ability to carry out duties effectively.  Failure To Meet Expectations  The mission also cited ""failure to meet expectations in serving Afghanistan's interests"" as one of the reasons.  ""We acknowledge our shortcomings in meeting the expectations and requirements necessary to serve the best interests of Afghanistan and its citizens due to the lack of diplomatic support in India and the absence of a legitimate functioning government in Kabul,"" it said.  It also said that due to unforeseen and unfortunate circumstances, there has been a significant reduction in both personnel and resources available to it, making it increasingly challenging to continue operations.  ""The lack of timely and sufficient support from visa renewal for diplomats to other critical areas of cooperation led to an understandable frustration among our team and impeded our ability to carry out routine duties effectively,"" the statement said.  Given these circumstances, ""it is with deep regret that we have taken the difficult decision to close all operations of the mission with the exception of emergency consular services to Afghan citizens till the transfer of the custodial authority of the mission to the host country,"" it said.  The embassy has been headed by Ambassador Farid Mamundzay. Mr Mamundzay was appointed by the previous Ashraf Ghani government and he has been operating as the Afghan envoy even after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021.  Power Tussle  In April-May, the embassy was rocked by a power struggle in the wake of reports of the Taliban appointing a charge d'affaires to head the mission, replacing Mr Mamundzay. Following the episode, the embassy came out with a statement that there was no change in its leadership.  The tussle for power had erupted after Qadir Shah, who was working as a trade councillor at the embassy since 2020, wrote to the MEA in late April claiming that he was appointed as the charge d'affaires at the embassy by the Taliban.  India is yet to recognise the Taliban set-up and has been pitching for the formation of a truly inclusive government in Kabul, besides insisting that Afghan soil must not be used for any terrorist activities against any country.  In its statement, the Afghan Embassy said this step is being taken in the best interest of the people of Afghanistan.  In accordance with Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961), all property and facilities of the Embassy will be transferred to the custodial authority of the host country, it said.  The embassy said it also wishes to address recent speculations and provide clarity on certain matters of importance.  In the three-page statement, the embassy categorically refuted any ""baseless claims"" regarding internal strife or discord amongst its diplomatic staff or any diplomats using the crisis to seek asylum in a third country.  ""Such rumours are unfounded and do not reflect the reality of our mission. We remain a united team working towards the best interests of Afghanistan,"" the embassy said.  The embassy also said it would like to verify the ""authenticity"" of an earlier communication with the Ministry of External Affairs regarding the intent to close the mission.  ""This communication accurately represents our decision-making process and the factors leading to the closure,"" the statement said.  ""We request the government of India to give serious consideration to the four requests outlined in the official note verbally submitted earlier. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of permitting the hoisting of the Afghan flag over the properties of our premises, as well as facilitating the smooth transition of the mission's buildings and assets to a legitimate government in Kabul in the future,"" the statement said.  The embassy also acknowledged that, given the gravity of this decision, ""there may be some who receive support and instructions from Kabul that may differ from our current course of action"".  The Embassy of Afghanistan made an ""unequivocal statement"" regarding the activities of certain consulates.  ""It is our firm belief that any actions taken by these consulates are not in consonance with the objectives of a legitimate or elected government and rather serve the interests of an illegitimate regime,"" the statement said.  The embassy also said it is keen to reach an agreement with the Indian government at the earliest possible juncture.

6,"Glasgow gurdwara incident: Envoy stopped from entering gurdwara, India flags it to UK","Amid the Delhi-Ottawa standoff over the killing of a Canada-based Khalistan separatist, Indian High Commissioner to the UK, Vikram Doraiswami, was stopped by three persons from entering a gurdwara in Glasgow while on a visit to Scotland.  Calling the incident “disgraceful”, the Indian High Commission has taken it up with the UK Foreign Office.  In a statement Saturday, the Indian High Commission in London said three persons from outside Scotland “deliberately disrupted” the visit Friday evening and one even attempted to violently force open the diplomatic vehicle as senior diplomats arrived at the Glasgow Gurdwara Guru Granth Sahib on Albert Drive.  As they hurled threats and abuses, the High Commissioner and Consul General of India decided to leave the premises to avert an altercation.  “On September 29, 2023, three persons – all from areas outside Scotland – disrupted a planned interaction organised by the Gurdwara Committee for the community, the High Commissioner (HC) and the Consul General of India (CG),” the Indian High Commission said.  “This interaction was to discuss community and consular issues. The organisers included senior community leaders, ladies and Committee members, and a member of (the) Scottish Parliament. They were threatened and abused by these elements. In an effort to prevent any potential altercation, the HC and CG decided to leave the premises shortly upon their arrival,” it said.  It said that one of three persons attempted to “violently force open the HC’s car door”, which will require suitable police consideration.  Advertisement  “It was due to the quick reaction of one of the organisers, who physically intervened at the car door, that a bigger incident was avoided. The High Commission of India has reported this disgraceful incident to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Metropolitan Police,” the statement said.  The Indian envoy was visiting Scotland to meet with the local authorities, university students, diaspora and members of the Scottish society.  CONCERNED: UK MINISTER  The FCDO Minister for Indo-Pacific, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, in a post on X, said she was “concerned to see” that the High Commissioner had been stopped from meeting the gurdwara committee in Glasgow.  Advertisement  “The safety and security of foreign diplomats is of utmost importance, and our places of worship in the UK must be open to all,” she said.  (PTI adds from London: The gurdwara committee and local community leaders have since expressed their regret over the incident and have called on the authorities to take action against the culprits.  The local police said it was called to the “disturbance”, and its enquiries remain ongoing.  “We were called around 1.05 pm on Friday, 29 September, to a report of a disturbance that happened in the Albert Drive area of Glasgow. There were no reports of any injuries, and enquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances,” said a Police Scotland spokesperson.)  The Glasgow incident comes amid the ongoing diplomatic row over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of a potential Indian government link to the killing of Khalistan separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India has rejected the allegations as “absurd” and “motivated”.  Advertisement  CALL OUT: JAISHANKAR  In Washington DC Saturday, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said it was necessary to call out activities like violence, threats and intimidation against Indian diplomats and missions.  He said when freedom of speech extends to incitement and violence, then it is a misuse of freedom.  Advertisement  “Let’s not normalise what is happening in Canada,” Jaishankar said during a media interaction.  “We have had an ongoing problem with Canada and the Canadian government for some years now. The ongoing problem really revolves around the permissiveness to terrorism, extremism and violence. This permissiveness is also reflected in the fact that some important extradition requests have not been responded to from their side,” he said.  Advertisement  “We have had smoke bombs thrown at the mission, we have had violence in front of consulates, there are posters put up. Do you consider this normal? If this had happened to any other country, how would they react? Let’s not normalise what is happening in Canada. It is important to call out what is happening there,” Jaishankar said.  “What is happening in Canada, had it happened anywhere else, do you think the world would’ve taken it with equanimity?” he asked.  He also said that it was not acceptable to make threats and intimidate diplomats in the name of freedom of speech.  “We don’t need to learn from other people what freedom of speech is about. But we can tell people this. We don’t think freedom of speech extends to incitement, to violence. That to us is a misuse of freedom,” he said.  Jaishankar said he always asks people one question: How would they react if they were in his place? “If it was your diplomats, your embassies, your people, what would be your reaction?” he asked.  He said the entire debate should focus not just on Issue One but also on Issue Two and the bigger picture, a very serious picture.  “After all, I was thinking… When was the last time that any of our missions was intimidated to a point where it could not continue with its normal function? I will have to think back. And if someone says this could happen in a G7 country, in a Commonwealth country, it gives you a lot to think about,” Jaishankar said.  On Trudeau’s allegations, he said India has already pointed out to Canada that this is not the Government of India’s policy.  “But if they are prepared to share with us specifics and anything relevant, we are also open to looking at it. So in that sense, that’s where the matter stands,” he said.  TARGETING OF MISSION  Besides having ignited the diplomatic row with Canada, the issue of Khalistan supporters has become an irritant in India-UK ties as well – protests have been staged outside the Indian High Commission and consulates in the UK.  Early this year, a group vandalised the Indian High Commission in London and tried to bring down the Indian flag at the premises.  New Delhi has consistently asked for security of its diplomats based in the UK.  Earlier this month, The Indian Express reported that the National Investigation Agency had identified 15 of the 45 people involved in the London incident and was preparing to send their details to the immigration department to issue lookout circulars against them.","In a statement Saturday, the Indian High Commission in London said three persons from outside Scotland “deliberately disrupted” the visit Friday evening and one even attempted to violently force open the diplomatic vehicle as senior diplomats arrived at the Glasgow Gurdwara Guru Granth Sahib on Albert Drive.

7,"Cauvery row: Review plea filed before CWMA against order to release 3,000 cusecs of water, says Siddaramaiah","The Karnataka government on September 30 filed a review petition before the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) against the order to release 3,000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu till October 15, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said.  After reviewing the situation, the government will also file a petition before the Supreme Court, the chief minister told reporters in Bengaluru.  The order to release 3,000 cusecs of water to the neighbouring state was issued last week by the Cauvery Water Regulation Committee (CWRC). The CWMA had, on September 29, upheld the CWRC's decision.  “A review petition was filed today before the Cauvery Water Management Authority regarding the Cauvery water release order. After reviewing the situation, a review petition will be filed before the Supreme Court,"" news agency ANI quoted Siddaramaiah as saying.  A day earlier, state officials held a meeting with retired judges of the Supreme Court and former advocate generals to seek their suggestions, Siddaramaiah said, adding that ""action will be taken accordingly"".  Exciting news! Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today by clicking the link and stay updated with the latest financial insights!"" Click here!  A state-wide bandh was observed in Karnataka on September 29 against the sharing of Cauvery water with Tamil Nadu. The protests were called by pro-Kannada groups and farmer outfits, and received the backing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (Secular).  Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar on September 29 said the state government will appeal to the CWMA to arrive at a ""new formula"" amidst the current period of distress. Due to insufficient rainfall between June and August, the state is facing severe water shortage, he pointed out.  “After today's Cauvery Management Authority meeting, a decision will be made as to what the outline of the formula in the distress year to be,"" he had said.  Notably, the Supreme Court had on September 21 refused to put a stay on the CWRC's directive to Karnataka to release 5,000 cusecs of water per day to Tamil Nadu. The water-sharing panel, however, later revised its order and asked the Siddaramaiah-led government to release 3,000 cusecs of water from September 28 to October 15.  Siddaramaiah's office had, in a statement issued following the meeting with former apex court judges and ex-advocate generals on September 29, said the state has proposed the formation of an advisory committee by the CWMA to discuss the sharing of water of all inter-state rivers in the period of distress.  “We propose the formation of an advisory committee, which will not be limited to the Cauvery but will handle all river disputes affecting the state. This committee will lend support to legal teams in any interstate water dispute cases,"" the statement noted.  Siddaramaiah also told the tribunal officials that the problem is rooted in the lack of rain received by Karnataka this year. “There was a problem due to no rain in the month of August. Even this month there is hardly any rain. Tamil Nadu will receive rain in the month of September. So far 43 TMC of water has gone. It has been ordered that 123 TMC of water should be released. But we have no water left,"" the statement added.  Karnataka, on the other hand, requires a total of 106 TMC of water, including 70 TMC for irrigation, 30 TMC for drinking water, and 3 TMC for industries, Siddaramaiah told the tribunal, adding that that the state currently only has 50 TMC of water.  The state's opposition, however, remained unimpressed with Siddaramaiah's efforts so far. It has questioned the “lack of dialogue"" with his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin to resolve the issue.  ""Any sensible and reasonable chief minister would have met the Tamil Nadu chief minister to discuss the dire situation related to sharing Cauvery water during the current distress time. Didn’t CM Siddaramaiah find time to talk to CM Stalin and discuss ways to resolve the grave situation?

8,"‘Mahatma Gandhi on one side, Godse on other': Rahul Gandhi on Congress-BJP fight","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday compared the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse while describing the difference in ideologies between the two parties.  The Congress MP was speaking at a 'Jan Aakrosh' rally in poll-bound Madhya Pradesh’s Shajapur. “This is a fight of ideologies. On one side, there is the Congress party and on the other side, the RSS and BJP. On one side, there is Mahatma Gandhi and on the other, there is Godse,” he said.  advertisement  He added that the fight between the Congress and the BJP was “hatred versus love and brotherhood”.  “Wherever they go they spread hatred. Now this has happened that Madhya Pradesh’s farmers and youth have started hating them. They are getting back what they did with people,” Rahul Gandhi said at the rally.  He added that he met several farmers in Madhya Pradesh during his Bharat Jodo Yatra.  “We walked 370 kilometres in Madhya Pradesh and met farmers, women and young people of the state. They told me a few things. The amount of corruption done by the BJP in Madhya Pradesh has not been done anywhere in the country.”  He added, “Farmers told me that they don’t get adequate price for their produce. In Chhattisgarh, we give Rs 2,500 for rice. We promised it and we fulfilled it.”  At the rally, Rahul Gandhi said that if Congress is elected to power, it will conduct a caste census.","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday compared the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse while describing the difference in ideologies between the two parties.

9,Will you be able to exchange or deposit Rs 2000 notes after September 30?,"No transactions, but deposits in bank accounts may still be allowed  Exchange facility may be made available but only at RBI  The time period set by RBI, to deposit and/or exchange Rs 2,000 currency notes will expire on September 30, 2023. If you still have Rs 2,000 notes and are yet to deposit and exchange them, make sure to do it before this deadline. This is because currently there is no clarity from RBI regarding what you can do with the Rs 2,000 notes in your possession after September 30, 2023. It is important to note that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not withdrawn the legal tender status of Rs 2,000 note. This means that the Rs 2,000 note will continue to be legal tender even after the expiry of the deadline.The RBI governor in a press interaction, after the announcement of the withdrawal of Rs 2000 note, said ""I can't give you a speculative answer as to what will happen after September 30. We have not said that the legal tender status (of the Rs 2,000 notes) will continue only up to September 30"". The deadline for deposits was fixed to ensure that the announcement is ""taken seriously"". ""Unless you give a particular time frame, the process won't reach a stage of finality,"" he further adds. This appears to imply that Rs 2000 notes continue to be 'legal tender'.As per an RBI press release dated September 1, 2023, ""93% of the Rs 2000 banknotes in circulation as on May 19, 2023, have since been returned."" As most of the notes have been returned to the banking system, the likelihood of extension of the deadline to deposit and exchange Rs 2000 notes is less.However, as the legal tender status of Rs 2000 note continues, the question arises as to what possible options an individual may have for the Rs 2000 notes that are not deposited or exchanged before the expiry of the deadline. 'Legal tender' status would appear to indicate that the RBI would have to provide some avenue of redeeming the monetary value of these notes. Consequently, one of the following scenarios may arise post September 30:It may happen that RBI bars the use of the Rs 2000 note for transaction purposes but allows individuals to deposit the notes in their KYC-compliant bank accounts. Remember, many shopkeepers and businesses have already stopped accepting Rs 2,000 notes for transactions after the RBI announced the withdrawal of notes.As mentioned above, RBI may, to avoid any hardship to the general public and because the notes remain legal tender, allow individuals to deposit Rs 2000 notes in KYC-compliant bank accounts even after September 30.The withdrawal of the Rs 2000 note is undertaken by the RBI as part of its 'Clean Note Policy'. A similar exercise was undertaken in 2013-14 to withdraw notes issued before 2005 from circulation. The notes continue to remain legal tender and individuals can exchange from specified RBI offices and deposit in their bank accounts, as per FAQs on the RBI website.The RBI may allow exchange of Rs 2000 notes only at its own offices on furnishing one's ID and address proofs. The RBI, while withdrawing Rs 2000 notes from circulation, allowed the exchange of Rs 2000 notes with a limit of Rs 20,000 at a time from any bank till September 30. The exchange facility is set up at 19 regional offices of RBI as well. Certain banks have not asked for ID proof while exchanging Rs 2000 notes while others have only exchanged the notes on submission of ID proof. However, the RBI may insist on KYC compliance to exchange Rs 2000 notes at its offices after September 30 to keep a record of the same.The RBI, while withdrawing pre-2005 notes, offered exchange facility at specified RBI offices. ""This, however, did not imply that banks cannot accept deposits of pre-2005 banknotes for crediting to the customers' accounts"", as per RBI FAQs on Indian currency on its website.","No transactions, but deposits in bank accounts may still be allowed  Exchange facility may be made available but only at RBI  The time period set by RBI, to deposit and/or exchange Rs 2,000 currency notes will expire on September 30, 2023.

His comments came ahead of India's first World Cup warm-up game against England in Guwahati. Ashwin was roped in as replacement after all-rounder Axar Patel was ruled out of the tournament due to an injury. Ashwin also admitted that his selection came as a shock to him as he ""wasn't thinking about"" being part of the squad.  ""I honestly wasn't thinking about being here (talking about his late selection for the World Cup). Enjoying the game has been my prime motto for the last four to five years and I would like to do that again in this tournament. I told the media guy that he shouldn't be putting me in front of camera for a while now, but this is probably one of those situations where he said Dinesh Karthik is interviewing you and I obliged the opportunity (chuckles),"" Ashwin was quoted as saying on Star Sports.  India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bat first against England in their ICC Cricket World Cup warm-up match at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium.  However, the start of the match has been delayed due to rain in Guwahati. Rain arrived moments before the start of the Indian innings.

16,"Aditya-L1 leaves ‘sphere of Earth’s influence’, navigating towards L1: Isro","NEW DELHI: Isro on Saturday evening announced that Aditya L1 spacecraft has “travelled beyond a distance of 9.2 lakh kilometres from the Earth , successfully escaping the sphere of Earth’s influence”.Even as the Isro is keeping a close watch on the movement of Aditya L1 to its destination point ‘L1’, it is simultaneously making preparations in full gear for its Venus mission ‘Shukrayaan’, which could be launched in December next year.Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space-based observatory to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (L1), located roughly 1.5 million km from the Earth, which is about 1% of the Earth-Sun distance.“It (Aditya L1) is now navigating its path towards L1. This is the second time in succession that Isro could send a spacecraft outside the sphere of influence of the Earth, the first time being the Mars orbiter mission,” Isro wrote on X.The strategic location of L1 will enable Aditya-L1 to continuously observe the Sun without being hindered by eclipses or occultation, allowing scientists to study solar activities and their impact on space weather in real-time. The spacecraft’s data will help identify the sequence of processes that lead to solar eruptive events.Isro chief S Somanath, meanwhile, said the mission to Venus, the brightest planet in the solar system, has already been configured and its payloads (scientific instruments) are being developed.The December 2024 window is being targeted for its launch with orbital manoeuvres planned for the following year when earth and Venus would be so aligned that the spacecraft could be put in the neighbouring planet’s orbit using a minimum amount of propellant. The next similar window will be available in 2031.Addressing the Indian National Science Academy in Delhi recently, the Isro chief had said, “Venus is a very interesting planet. It also has an atmosphere. Its atmosphere is so thick... The atmospheric pressure is 100 times that of Earth and it is full of acids. You cannot penetrate the surface. You don’t know if its surface is hard or not. Why are we trying to understand all of this? Earth could one day be Venus. I don’t know. Maybe 10,000 years later we (Earth) will change our characteristics. Earth was never like this. It was not a habitable place long long back.”Missions to Venus launched earlier include European Space Agency’s Venus Express (orbited from 2006 to 2016) and Japan’s Akatsuki Venus Climate Orbiter (orbiting since 2016). Nasa’s Parker Solar Probe has made multiple flybys of Venus.","NEW DELHI: Isro on Saturday evening announced that Aditya L1 spacecraft has “travelled beyond a distance of 9.2 lakh kilometres from the Earth , successfully escaping the sphere of Earth’s influence”.Even as the Isro is keeping a close watch on the movement of Aditya L1 to its destination point ‘L1’, it is simultaneously making preparations in full gear for its Venus mission ‘Shukrayaan’, which could be launched in December next year.Aditya-L1 is the first Indian space-based observatory to study the Sun from a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (L1), located roughly 1.5 million km from the Earth, which is about 1% of the Earth-Sun distance.“It (Aditya L1) is now navigating its path towards L1.

17,NASA to launch Psyche mission on October 12 to reveal mysteries of the metal-rich asteroid,"Psyche mission team members prepare the spacecraft at a facility near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late July, just after the solar arrays were folded and stowed. (Image credit: NASA)  NASA and SpaceX are targeting an October 12 lift-off for the Psyche mission, which will launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and will be carried into space aboard a Falcon Heavy rocket. The main goal of the Psyche mission is to conduct a comprehensive study of the unique metal-rich asteroid, also named Psyche, which is orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.  What happens after the launch  The Psyche spacecraft will begin its six-year-long journey into space after lifting off on a Falcon Heavy rocket and separating from the launch vehicle. This mission will cover over 2.2 billion miles (3.6 billion km). The Psyche spacecraft will use solar electric propulsion for the duration of its extensive mission in order to arrive at the asteroid in 2029.  Mission objectives  The Psyche spacecraft, after it arrives at its destination, will spend 26 months studying and analysing the Psyche asteroid. The tasks of the mission include image capture, surface mapping, data collection to assess the chemical composition, and conducting research to understand the formation process of planets.  According to NASA, the origins of the Psyche asteroid remain a mystery to scientists, making the mission a crucial effort to uncover its secrets. This mission offers an opportunity to delve into the specifics of the asteroid, including its topography characteristics.  Scientists at NASA speculate that the Psyche asteroid could be part of the metal-rich interior of planetesimal, a building block of a rocky planet. Alternatively, it might belong to a category of celestial objects that has never been observed before. Furthermore, the space agency said the asteroid ""is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run collisions, common when the solar system was forming"". Thus, Psyche mission, the first such to a metal-rich asteroid, may be able to tell the world ""how rocky planets like our own Earth formed, what makes up Earth’s core, how Earth’s core and the cores of the other rocky planets came to be.""  Additionally, NASA has revealed that, based on indications suggesting that Psyche once possessed a magnetic field, a hardware instrument onboard the spacecraft will look for the evidence.

""DSOC will send test data to and from Earth using an invisible near-infrared laser, which has much higher bandwidth than radio wave systems currently used on spacecraft,"" NASA elaborated.  The telecommunications system intended primarily to send data and receive commands will also be used to conduct gravity science. Scientists can determine the asteroid’s rotation, wobble, mass, and gravity field, the space agency said.  Scientists' knowledge about asteroid Psyche: An overview  The consensus among scientists, as reported on NASA's website, is that the giant asteroid Psyche is a potato-shaped rock made primarily of metal. It is reported by the space agency that in telescopes, the asteroid is only visible to scientists as a small dot of light. It measures roughly 144 miles (232 kms) in length and 140 miles (226 kms) in width. NASA emphasizes that the asteroid's true appearance will not be known until the Psyche mission provides a close-up view of it.","Psyche mission team members prepare the spacecraft at a facility near NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in late July, just after the solar arrays were folded and stowed.

18,"Surge In Cardiovascular Diseases Linked To Diabetes, Hypertension & High Cholesterol In Youth: Experts","Surge In Cardiovascular Diseases Linked To Diabetes, Hypertension & High Cholestrol In Youth, Say Experts | Photo Credit: Pinterest  Mumbai: Symptoms of cardiovascular diseases often go unnoticed in children and young adults due to their traditional association with older individuals. This lack of awareness frequently leads to undiagnosed cardiovascular conditions in young people, resulting in severe health complications and, tragically, even fatalities. The primary driver of these heart diseases in our country appears to be the escalating epidemic of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.  According to doctors, young adult populations are suffering more from heart diseases compared to the elderly. They highlighted a significant increase in cardiovascular cases, including heart attacks, affecting both young men and women, causing widespread concern. Hence, there is a need to raise awareness among both youths and their parents and promote overall physical and mental well-being.  Read Also World Suicide Prevention Day 2023: 10 Ways To Tackle And Beat Depression  Hypertension & high cholesterol- main causes for heart attacks  Dr. Hisham Ahamed, Associate Professor and Consultant Cardiologist at Amrita Hospital, Kochi, stated that diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol are the silent culprits behind the surge in heart attacks among young people. It is crucial to note that everyone can be equally predisposed to these conditions, and regular check-ups, especially after the age of 40, are important.  “We have observed numerous young patients, including athletes, with heart diseases linked to strong genetic factors, such as atherosclerotic disease that often leads to heart attacks and myocardial infarctions, particularly in families with a history of it. Our approach involves genetic testing for precise risk assessment and intervention, incorporating medication and lifestyle adjustments. Additionally, cardiomyopathies like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy significantly contribute to sudden deaths, especially among athletes and those under 45 years old,” he said.  Lifestyle factors and other comorbidities undoubtedly play a significant role in individuals with a strong family history of heart disease.  Dr. Saritha Sekhar, Adult Cardiologist at Amrita Hospital, Kochi, said that in recent years, they have observed a worrisome shift in cardiovascular health, markedly different from two decades ago. A rising number of younger individuals now experience multiple blockages in their blood supply. Importantly, this trend is not gender-specific as it was previously believed that women were protected from heart disease during menopause. However, this is no longer the case.  “Young females are developing multiple risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, and thyroid disease. These factors, combined with the obesity epidemic and sedentary lifestyles, contribute to heart disease in younger individuals. Although the disease's nature is similar in both genders, the evolving landscape underscores the growing vulnerability of young females to heart disease and early heart attacks,” she said.  Health experts have also highlighted an additional factor contributing to heart problems—an increasing prevalence of depression. Depression is often overlooked in both urban and rural areas and has emerged as a significant risk factor for heart diseases, particularly coronary conditions such as heart attacks.  Depression:  Dr. Rajesh Thachathodiyl, Senior Interventional Cardiologist, Professor & Head of Adult Cardiology at Amrita Hospital, Kochi, added, ""Depression, often overlooked, significantly increases the risk of heart diseases, especially conditions like heart attacks and blockages. Social biases discouraging open discussions on mental health, considered taboo in India, exacerbate this issue. The rising prevalence of depression adds to the health challenge, impacting urban and rural areas alike. Reluctance to seek help for mental health problems jeopardizes heart health. Recognising depression as a critical risk factor and dismantling the stigma surrounding mental health discussions is crucial.""  Pointers:  Contrary to popular belief, young females are now equally at risk, with factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and thyroid issues coming into play.  Depression, often underestimated, poses a significant risk for heart disease, particularly coronary conditions like heart attacks and blockages.
